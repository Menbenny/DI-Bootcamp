                Major League DJs consists of twins Bandile and Banele. This twin set
                is a dynamic duo bringing fresh energy to every platform they engage
                with. Born in Boston, USA, the twins moved to South Africa after the
                apartheid era. Being exposed to music at a very young age, Major 
                League DJs were highly influenced by the sounds of Jazz and Hip-Hop 
                music which ushered them into the entertainment industry in their 
                early teens. <span id="more">The duo’s vision is to use music to unify
                youth across Africa. Major League DJs aspire to play music for Africa
                by Africans in an attempt to change the perception of African Hip Hop.
                The twins are well on their way to achieving this goal through their Urban
                Breeze events which currently occur weekly in the Alexandra township and
                have steered up a generous Hip Hop following in an otherwise House music
                dominated territory.</span>
