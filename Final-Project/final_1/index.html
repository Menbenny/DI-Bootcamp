            <p>
                Major League DJs consists of twins Bandile and Banele. This twin set
                is a dynamic duo bringing fresh energy to every platform they engage
                with. Born in Boston, USA, the twins moved to South Africa after the
                apartheid era. Being exposed to music at a very young age, Major 
                League DJs were highly influenced by the sounds of Jazz and Hip-Hop 
                music which ushered them into the entertainment industry in their 
                early teens. The duo’s vision is to use music to unify
                youth across Africa. Major League DJs aspire to play music for Africa
                by Africans in an attempt to change the perception of African Hip Hop.
                The twins are well on their way to achieving this goal through their Urban
                Breeze events which currently occur weekly in the Alexandra township and
                have steered up a generous Hip Hop following in an otherwise House music
                dominated territory.

            <p>Let's check out some of Major League Djz World tours</p>

                <p id="tour_1">
                    The Major League DJs have performed at some of the biggest music festivals in the world, including the Ultra Music Festival in Miami and the Amsterdam Dance Event. They have also headlined their own world tours, performing in cities across Africa, Europe, and Asia.

                <p id="tour_2"> 
                    One of their most successful tours was the Major League Gardens tour, which took place in 2019 and saw the brothers perform in six cities across South Africa. The tour was a huge success, with over 50,000 fans attending the concerts.

                <p id="tour_3">    
                    In 2020, the Major League DJs were set to embark on a world tour that would have taken them to cities across the United States, Europe, and Asia. However, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the brothers have since focused on producing new music and performing virtual concerts for their fans.
