#  9 conditions for each player - as per grid box --


    
# Function for display board 
# Store players input onto the display board
# Create a condition which satifies creation of list 
# if the list contains a row with "x" or "o", player wins

#           Player input condition draft 
#           Condition should state which player is the winner

# 3 lists
# if 'x' or 'o' == list1[0] == list1[ยง1] == list2[2]
